# Gravity_Simulation
Gravity simulation in which physics rules are applied on 3 boxes with three different physical properties and simulate gravity while they're falling off a ramp in 2d and
the 3 boxes position, velocity and acceleration are ploted and shown live by time. coded in python and using vpython library and physutil.py.
